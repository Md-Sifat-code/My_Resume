So, how did I start my LeetCode journey?\n\nI began by solving at least two problems per day, without rushing. I focused on building the logic behind each solution and then visualizing it in code. Whenever I failed, I tried to think of the problem in a different way. When I couldn't figure out the logic, I took help from other people's solutions, but I made sure to keep my code the same, only upgrading it based on the logic. My goal was to build complex logic in the simplest way I could."
